This is a simple Google Maps API travel calculator. Basically we have the client input their address on the webform, the form sends a WP REST call that provides the data. We then use this data to call Google API to gather the place ID, and then perform a distance calulation with the place ID generated, and the Place ID that is safed from within the Admin page.

Use the sort code [ggetravelcostshcode] on the Google Travel Calulator page. Don't use this on a standard post.

All of these scripts are created for a mobile game theatre company which I previously owned. All rights an property of these documents are owned by myself. Feel free to use this scripts as you see fit. Just remember to perform an npm -i on the javascript file location's
